# Variational Autoencoder

I want to try and see how semi-supervised learning works with a variational autoencoder. I am using the credit card fraud dataset that I obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud).


My first attempt was really bad. I didn't get a good AUC at all. I got an AUC of 0.75 with the latest configuration of the parameters of the vae.
